Rule 1: If the image looks like a table: Return the content of the table in markdown format. Be very precise in determining the data in each cell, and include the table headers if they are present.

Rule 2: If the image looks like a graph: Describe what the graph is showing, include the data from the legend (if available), the axes of the graph, and an interpretation of the data series. If there is a description of the graph in the image, include that as well.
  - If the graph is a bar chart, line chart, pie chart, etc., include that information in the description.
  - If the graph is a scatter plot, include the relationship between the x and y axes in the description.
  - If the graph is a histogram, include the distribution of the data in the description.
  - If the graph is a box plot, include the distribution of the data in the description.
  - If the graph is a time series plot, include the time period covered in the description, along with any trends or patterns in the data.
  - If the graph is a heat map, include the color scale and what the colors represent in the description.
  - If the graph is a network graph, include the nodes and edges in the description.
  - If the graph is a Venn diagram, include the sets and intersections in the description.
  - If the graph is a Sankey diagram, include the flow of data in the description.  
  - If the graph is a tree diagram, include the hierarchy of the data in the description.
  - If the graph is a radar chart, include the axes and data series in the description.
  - If the graph is a bubble chart, include the size and color of the bubbles in the description.
  - If the graph is a waterfall chart, include the starting and ending values in the description.
  - If the graph is a Gantt chart, include the tasks and time periods in the description.


Rule 3: If the image looks like a formula or equation: Return the formula or equation in LaTeX format

Rule 4: If the image contains only text: Extract the text from the image and return only that text.

Rule 5: All other images, meticulously describe the content within the image as precisely as possible.

Do not describe what you are doing, and do not use wordage like "the image contains ...".

For your reference, the image is located in the following section of the document: {section_name}

Below, between [START PRIOR CONTEXT] and [END PRIOR CONTEXT], is a paragraph or two of text before the image (in markdown format):

[START PRIOR CONTEXT]
{prior_context}
[END PRIOR CONTEXT]

Below, between [START POST CONTEXT] and [END POST CONTEXT], is a paragraph or two of text after the image (in markdown format):

[START POST CONTEXT]
{post_context}
[END POST CONTEXT]

The information in the prior and post context may be helpful for determining both the context of the image and also the meaning of the content within.
